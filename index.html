                <img src="hourglass.jpg" alt="hourglass" width="20%" height="20%">
                <h3>Faster</h3>
                <p>International transfers through banks can take a number of days to process because of intermediaries and strict procedures. Therefore, stablecoins will allow value to move almost instantly across borders, where most transactions can complete in seconds or minutes. This speed is necessary for traders and businesses that need quick access to funds.</p>

                <h3>Opportunities For Innovation</h3>
                <p>Stablecoins are not just a digital currency but also a foundation for building new applications. Developers can create financial services like lending platforms, savings tools, and payment systems that operate on top of stablecoin technology. This innovation drives economic growth and provides users with more flexible and transparent options than traditional finance.</p>

                <h3>Lower Transaction Fees</h3>
                <p>Traditional banks and money transfer services often charge high fees for cross-border payments. Stablecoins use blockchain networks, which cut out many middlemen, reducing the cost of sending and receiving money internationally. This makes them especially useful for small traders and workers sending remittances. Also anyone with a smartphone and internet can use stablecoins, even without a traditional bank account.</p>

            <h1>What is Stablecoin?</h1>
            <div class="about-stbcoin">
                <p>A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a real-world asset like the US dollar, euro, or gold. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate wildly, stablecoins provide a predictable value, making them useful for payments, savings, and trading.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-stbcoin">
                <p>While most cryptocurrencies are used for investment, speculation, or powering blockchain networks, stablecoins are mainly used for payments, savings, and quick transfers, because people trust their price will not swing wildly.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size:30px; padding: 10% 10% 1% 0%;">Why do they matter in Africa?</h2>
            <p class="about-stbcoin">Sending money across borders is expensive — fees can go as high as 10%. Stablecoins allow almost instant transfers at very low cost. They also provide protection against inflation, giving people a way to store value more securely than in unstable local currencies.</p>

            <p class="about-stbcoin">However, stablecoins are not risk-free. Some are centralized, meaning one company controls them, and others can lose their value if reserves are mismanaged. Governments are also working on regulations to make them safer.</p>
